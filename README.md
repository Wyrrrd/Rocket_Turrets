### Features
This mod adds a rocket turret to make rockets great againâ„¢. Sadly you would only get one single, boring, depressingly gray type of turret, unless you also play with Bob's Mods. Please think a moment before you load atomic rockets... because it probably won't end well...

### Compatibility
This mod should just work, but I specifically added compatibility for the following mods:

+ [Bob's Warfare](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobplates) - more turrets (MK2-MK5)
+ [Bob's Metals, Chemicals and Intermediates](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobplates) - replace recipe ingredients similar to how Bob's Warfare depends on it

### Locale
If you want to contribute by translating this mod, you can view the existing translations [here](https://github.com/Wyrrrd/Rocket_Turrets/tree/master/locale). I'd be happy to add your language and credits to the next release.
